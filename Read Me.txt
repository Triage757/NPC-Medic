****Type getpos in your conolse to your coordinates!*****

Installation Instructions

1. Go to your Garrys Mod/Addon directory. 
2. Drag and drop the "NPC-Medic" folder into your addons folder. 
3. To edit the position of the NPC go to "NPC-Medic/lua/autorun" and open sh_healnpc.
4. To change the position of the NPC edit the first line. Remember to seperate with commas.
5. To edit the direction the NPC faces change the middle number on the second line.


Notes
*I plan on adding a config file.
*Also plan on adding the npc to calculate your health and then give you a price to heal you. So instead of chargin a flat rate it will charge you only by the amount of health you acutally need.
